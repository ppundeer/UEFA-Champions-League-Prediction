# UEFA-Champions-League-Prediction

I tried to predict the match outcomes, thus the standings in UEFA Champions League season 2019-2020 by developing a statistical model that uses player ratings (derived team scores) to determine the outcome of the match.

1. Databases to be used:
    FIFA 19 player dataset
    2018-2019 match results from top European Leagues (~3000 matches)
    
2. Models to be developed:
A predictor model is developed using 2018-2019 match results and player dataset. It is then used to predict Champions League match outcomes. My approach is categorisation of match outcomes (Home, Away, Draw) thus testing KNN and Random Forest.

After various combinations of knockout fixtures, Juventus turns out to be the champion by our model for most cases. So, we will proudly present the winning trophy to Critiano Ronaldo, his dream could finally come true (just for this model).
We see that out of all quarter finalist, four of them, 'Paris Saint-Germain', 'FC Bayern München', 'Manchester City', and 'Olympique Lyonnais', were actual quarter finalist in UCL 19-20. So our model predictions turns out to be 50% accurate. The real champions of UCL 19-20, team 'FC Bayern München' was able to make it to the finals in our model as well.
