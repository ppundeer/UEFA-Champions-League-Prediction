# UEFA-Champions-League-Prediction

I tried to predict the match outcomes, thus the standings in UEFA Champions League season 2019-2020 by developing a statistical model that uses player ratings (derived team scores) to determine the outcome of the match.

1. Databases to be used:
    FIFA 19 player dataset
    2018-2019 match results from top European Leagues (~3000 matches)
    
2. Models to be developed:
A predictor model is developed using 2018-2019 match results and player dataset. It is then used to predict Champions League match outcomes. My approach is categorisation of match outcomes (Home, Away, Draw) thus testing KNN and Random Forest.
